# algae-plot
A sample CSV file was provided, containing algae tracker sample data between Jun 27th, 2022 to June 28th, 2022. The goal of the exercise is to develop a software using the language of your choice (Java, Javascript, etc.) to draw a 2D plot. The X axis will be the time stamp of the data samples (e.g. 6/27/22 00:04:48). The Y axis will be the battSOC values.

A sample plot was attached in the project to show the expected 2D plot for the exercise. Please submit the source code that can be used to create the 2D plot.
